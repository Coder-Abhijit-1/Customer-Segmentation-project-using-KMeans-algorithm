# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project focuses on **unsupervised customer segmentation** using the **K-Means clustering algorithm**. It aims to classify customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, helping businesses target each group with personalized strategies.

> 💼 This was a collaborative group project completed by a team of 4 members.

## 📌 Objective

To segment customers based on their annual income and spending score, enabling businesses to:
- Identify high-value customers
- Customize marketing strategies
- Improve customer engagement and retention

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn (KMeans)**

---

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset used is a **Mall Customers Dataset**, consisting of:
  - `CustomerID`
  - `Gender`
  - `Age`
  - `Annual Income (k$)`
  - `Spending Score (1-100)`

---

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**
   - Checked for null/missing values
   - Visualized data distribution

2. **Feature Selection**
   - Focused on `Annual Income` and `Spending Score`

3. **Elbow Method**
   - Used to determine optimal number of clusters (k)

4. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Applied algorithm with selected `k` value
   - Visualized resulting customer segments

5. **Interpretation**
   - Analyzed clusters to identify distinct customer groups

---

## 📈 Results

- Customers were successfully segmented into meaningful clusters such as:
  - High Income / Low Spending
  - Low Income / High Spending
  - Balanced Spenders
  - Potential Loyal Customers
